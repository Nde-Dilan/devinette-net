/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for DevinetteNet.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a separation between pending riddle submissions and validated riddles.
 * Pending riddles are submitted to `/riddles_pending/{riddleId}` and only become accessible once moved to `/riddles/{riddleId}`.
 * All validated riddles in the `/riddles` collection are considered public and can be read by any user.
 * Only authenticated users can create pending riddles, but updates and deletes are restricted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/riddles/{riddleId}`: Public collection for validated riddles.
 * - `/riddles_pending/{riddleId}`: Collection for pending riddle submissions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Validated riddles are publicly readable.
 * - Only authenticated users can submit pending riddles.
 * - Updates and deletes are not allowed on either validated or pending riddles.
 * - Listing of pending riddles is disabled.
 * - The rules do NOT enforce the schema or specific data types of the Riddle entity, except for relational integrity checks during creation.
